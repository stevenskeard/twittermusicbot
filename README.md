# twittermusicbot
A bot that parses incoming tweets, downloads songs from youtube, and then plays them

This is Python code from circa 2013 that I found in an old backup

Originally run on a RaspberryPi and it ran fine

Depends on a few previously installed items:
    Python Dependencies:
        1. Twython
        2. requests
    Other Dependencies:
        1. youtube-dl
        2. omxplayer

This is by no means the best way to do any of this but it was a fun project at the time
